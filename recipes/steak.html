            <h3>Description</h3>
            Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, broiled, or grilled. It takes to marinades wonderfully, and really can be substituted for any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time to trim it well. In this recipe, we will be cooking the steak on a pan as opposed to a grill.
